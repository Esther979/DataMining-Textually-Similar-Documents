The problem with glitter
Pretty, sparkly, and really hard to get rid of. Forms of glitter have been used for decoration since at least Aztec times and can be found on ornaments, clothes, greeting cards and cosmetics. However, today's glitter is often made of plastic, and this makes it more dangerous than it appears.
Pieces of glitter are often washed into the water system, and from there into seas and rivers. Here, they become microplastic pollution. Fish often mistake small plastic particles for food and eat them. When something low in the food chain is eaten by predators, they also consume the microplastics left in their prey. If we eat seafood, that includes us. While there are still questions about the impact of this, microplastics have been linked with issues including DNA damage, organ dysfunction and cardiovascular problems. It's been estimated that humans may ingest between 74,000 and 121,000 microplastic particles each year.
Glitter only makes up a tiny part of the microplastics found in the ocean, but it can be particularly harmful. Firstly, while most microplastics in marine environments are formed by large pieces of plastic breaking down, glitter is manufactured as a microplastic. It is also made up of several different compounds which can leach toxins into the surrounding environment.
Additionally, a recent study has suggested that glitter particles can encourage the formation of certain mineral crystals, changing the chemistry of the environment around them. Not only could this affect how sea life produces shells and skeletons, but the crystals can break up the particles further, forming nanoplastics. These are even more likely to be absorbed by marine organisms.
Biodegradable alternatives have been developed, although some studies suggest that these could be just as harmful. Maybe we should just find a different way to make decorations.
