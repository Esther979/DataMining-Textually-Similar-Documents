Nature that glows
Early in the morning in June 2024, photographer Lee McGrath captured electric blue shimmering in the waves of Dunraven Bay, Wales. Lighting up the water was bioluminescent plankton.
Bioluminescence is the ability of certain organisms to produce light. It's a biochemical wonder involving a reaction between certain chemicals that create light without heat. Plankton, as seen in Wales, are tiny marine drifters, carried by ocean tides and currents. And they're not the only creatures in the ocean with this illuminating characteristic – an amazing 76% of animals in our seas are bioluminescent, according to National Geographic. It happens for a variety of reasons. For example, the deep-sea anglerfish has a glowing fin that sticks out of its head to attract prey, and jellyfish can emit light to attract mates. Similarly, the six-inch lantern shark, one of the world's smallest sharks, has light-up organs used for camouflage.
But it's not just ocean life that can glow in the dark. On land, fireflies dance with glowing abdomens as part of courtship rituals, while some fungi, such as the honey mushroom, contribute an eerie glow in forests, and are known as 'ghost mushrooms' in some cultures. In New Zealand, there is a freshwater snail which emits a glowing slime, and glow-worm caves attract hundreds of thousands of tourists a year.
Scientists are discovering more and more glowing nature each year, says Linda Reinhold, an Australian scientist, but there's still a lot we don't know. She says it's easiest to see bioluminescent nature on land by using a UV torch, so next time you head out at night, pack one! You never know what you'll find.
