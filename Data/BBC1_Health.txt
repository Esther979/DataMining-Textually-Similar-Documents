How is ginger good for us?
It's normal for our bodies to not always be in tip-top condition, whether we catch the flu, have aching muscles after lots of exercise or get travel sick. But there's an ingredient that can help with all of that, and it can be used in all sorts of ways.
Ginger isn't just something to have in the kitchen – it's been used as an aid for centuries. Research consistently shows it eases nausea, such as motion sickness, and is recommended as a remedy by the NHS for helping ease pregnancy sickness. Anna Daniels, a dietitian and spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, says it's so beneficial because it has "powerful anti-inflammatory properties which assist with reducing inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract and therefore relieve discomfort and settle upset stomachs."
And it can help with more than just nausea. Ginger tea has been shown to help fight colds and flu because it encourages perspiration, which in turn reduces feverish symptoms. Gingerol, a bioactive compound in the spice, has been found to help reduce the risk of infections because it supports immune health, including autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. And if you're sporty, there's good news for you too. Studies by the International Journal of Preventative Medicine and The Journal of Pain found that a daily supplement of ginger eased muscle soreness after intense physical activity.
So, how can you use ginger? It's an incredibly versatile ingredient and can be used in almost anything from tea to biscuits to fiery stir-fries. Many cafes and supermarkets now sell ginger shots promoting health benefits. Emily Jonzen, author of The Goodness of Ginger and Turmeric, suggests grating it, though she advises "it has a strong flavour and a fieriness to it so introduce it to your cooking a little at a time".
So, if you like the taste, you could incorporate it into your diet and see if you feel these health benefits.
